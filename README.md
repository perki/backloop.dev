# `backloop.dev` 

Loopback domain and SSL certs to handle HTTPS on localhost. 

## Why ?

When you locally develop web applications that intensively use AJAX REST requests. CORS layer is enforced by pure HTTPS only policies from browsers to avoid **mixed content** between HTTP & HTTPS sources.

Backloop.dev SSL certificates enable localhost HTTPS.

All `*.backloop.dev` hostnames point to `127.0.0.1` and `::1`.
